Anuradha: Hi everyone, welcome to my YouTube
channel.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.680
This is the first video for my interview series
and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.820
I am so excited to have my first guest as
Santosh yadav.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.610
So he is a very special guest for me.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.610
Welcome Santosh.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.790
Santosh: Thanks a lot Anuradha, it has been
an honor to be like your first guest.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.367
Anuradha: Thank you, I am so grateful that
you accepted my request.

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:31.849
Anuradha: I would like to talk a little bit
about Santosh, like give a little bit of introduction.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.600
So, he is one of the very active community
builders out there,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.690
who are helping people in tech community.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.160
He is a Google Developers Expert for Angular
and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.370
he is also a GitHub Star.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.880
Actually, fun fact, he is the first person
from India to be the GitHub star.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.930
And he does a lots of open source work and
content creation,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.100
speaking at international conferences.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.300
And, he helps people in tech community.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.580
So we are really glad to have you in tech
community, to be very honest, Santosh. Thanks

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580
a lot.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.640
Santosh: Thank you!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.910
Anuradha: Okay, so since we are talking about
tech community

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.230
so I would like to start my first question
with that only.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.840
So, like you have lots of involvement in the
tech community and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.130
I would like to ask what is your motivation
behind it,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.900
how do you keep going ?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.000
Santosh: My main motivation was just to give
back to the community

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.740
So, when I actually started contributing to
open source,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.090
the whole motive was, I have actually made
my career out of open source and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.820
now, it's time to give back.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.140
I realise that I am using it, everything for
free now and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.340
I don't even give money to anyone, and I
am making

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.120
more money than I need.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.210
So, that's how it started. And I thought,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.720
let's go back and give back to the community
and then I searched for it.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.030
I mean, I was not aware where to actually
look out for the community, so

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.849
of course, as being, I think it is with almost all Indians that we

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.590
we are more active on facebook rather than
twitter. That's how it was for me as well.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030
So, and then I realized that the entire community
is actually not on facebook,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.610
they are on twitter, you can actually reach
out to anyone.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.469
I mean from Google team, or let say Microsoft,
that's how it started,

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.150
and I started becoming more active on twitter,
and started

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.480
getting involved with Angular, like content
creation, or doing open source work.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.739
That's how it all started, but yeah

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.980
the main motive was to actually give back to the community because of course,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.800
I was not doing that.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.840
Anuradha: that's actually a very noble cause
I would say.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.900
And definitely, because we get a lot out of
the community,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.709
everything we do in all our projects and everything,
it's lots of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.599
open source things we are consuming.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.870
So, it only makes sense to give back, yeah.
Definitely.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.459
And actually I would really concur with you
because before few years,

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.420
i did not know much about twitter, so there
was just facebook and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.530
personally I did not like it a lot, so I don't
have any accounts still on facebook,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.060
but when I discovered Twitter, it was really
nice, because

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.221
I could see lots of tech content, and

00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.069
opportunity to talk with tech community,

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.530
and get to know what's happening and all.
So,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.900
it has been a game changer, really.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.930
I mean, twitter is a really nice place, at
least,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.329
I have also found it really nice to connect
with the tech community.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.329
So, yeah,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.191
You do a lots of content creation, and all,
so I am going to ask you

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:40.709
maybe a universal question but

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.220
Do you get nervous while presenting or creating
content?

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.580
&lt;&lt;I was so nervous I kept laughing a lot,
phew&gt;&gt;

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.400
Santosh: Everytime!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.049
So, I have done like 50-60 livestreams but,

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.599
evertime I actually start my livestream, I
am like

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.150
Oh My God, I am going to , what I am going
to do.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.870
And how am I doing it, and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.540
why am I doing it?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.889
I am really scared,

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:01.889
but yeah, I mean

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.060
but once it starts, right, so you get into
the flow.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.939
Even like presenting any talks, I mean I know
the content,

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.379
I know what needs to be presented. I can even
just blindly in my dreams,

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.250
or in my sleep also I can just tell you about
what I am about to present.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.810
But, when you go live, right,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.890
it really actually makes you so nervous.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.850
So, yeah that I think happens with everyone.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.890
I even remember my first talk which I gave,
in person talk which I gave

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.080
at (ng) Sri Lanka, and I was like

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.713
within 5 minutes, i was like, I was not even
be able to breathe,

00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:39.040
because I was just running on the entire stage,
from here to there,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.780
and I was like, okay what am I doing right
now.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.010
And, of course, yeah I was really nervous
presenting something in

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.600
front of 300 people. So,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.120
it happens, i think it's natural.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.240
Anuradha: Yeah, exactly

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.570
I mean, I always actually thought that maybe
it

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.682
gets better the next time, but

00:04:56.682 --> 00:05:00.700
everytime I am like, okay it should just start,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.150
because, I mean, like maybe the 5-10 minutes
before the start,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.360
you feel the heat, like

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.240
what will, is going to happen and yeah

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.080
when it starts, it starts. Like,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.690
for today also, I was very nervous before&nbsp;starting
the recording, but yeah

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.390
I mean it's fine now (No it was not, I was
still nervous )

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.552
So, I would also like to ask you, like is
there any

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:20.770
tip which you would like to give,?

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.020
I talk to lots of people and they are like,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.650
they always feel that will they be able to
talk on screen and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.480
will they be really able to keep up with the
audience hopes, and all.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.840
So, they get lots of anxiousness and nervousness.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.040
So, like do you have any tips for the newcomers,
like do not feel alone,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.320
everybody gets nervous, and all.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.690
Santosh: I mean, so from past 2 years, we
are actually just doing virtual things, right.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.580
So I would say whenever you are going virtual,
I think, uh, the thing is.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.690
you should concentrate on your content, don't
think

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.310
because there is no one to actually give you
feedback, right,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.740
Especially when you are doing live streams
and, like giving a talk in a virtual

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740
conference,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.900
no one is there to actually give you feedback.
So remember,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.390
just try to be yourself and just have confidence
on yourself, that will pay.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.610
But in case you are actually presenting in
a, like, in-person conference,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.240
I think, the entire scenario changes, right.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.470
Now you have people in front of you.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.440
So try to make as much as eye contact as possible.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.600
Try to, I mean, of course not with 300 people,
but some people, right, I mean okay.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.440
They are listening to you and, again, like

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.760
if you have your content, don't like try to
go out of your content.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.870
Right. You know, your content really well.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.920
So sometime it happens that okay, in just
flow, we actually talk about something else,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.770
which isn't related to your content, but probably
you didn't want it to mention it. Right.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.350
And then entire talk stretches up and entire
topic goes somewhere else. And everyone is

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.350
confused.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.780
So try to like concentrate on what your topic is.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.300
And of course, eye contact and, be cool.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.430
I mean, so the first mistake which I made
in my first conference,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.060
which I went to, so I was running on the entire
floor.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.560
I mean, so I was like breathless in like 5
to 10 minutes.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.890
So, and, uh, I think have a bottle of water
with you because you need it.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.200
Anuradha: Yeah. I mean, yeah, really, really
nice tips because

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.010
I realized that I also make it sometime like
I'm talking and

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.280
suddenly I want to talk about a little bit
more about that, and then you realize that,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.210
okay, you have used up the time for talking
something else.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.860
Now you need to cut something from your content
if you want to be on time.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.200
So yeah, definitely stick to the content and
be confident.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.100
And so I was wondering like how do you choose
topics for your content

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.370
like, uh, I mean, do you have any, scheduling
routine that you follow, like,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.730
or write down something whenever you come
across it.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.730
How do you do it?

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.360
Santosh: So, this year I have not given
so many talks.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.870
I generally repeat my talks because generally

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.770
what I try to do is - have something which
is hands-on.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.640
So probably you will find something like,
mostly related to coding,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.960
how you can improve the performance, all those
things. So,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.950
I try not to do like content, which is just
like coming in and talking until and unless

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.290
it's like 30 minutes or 45 minute slot.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:29.530
That's why I generally, I, in this year, of
course it was just like I did, I didn't do

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.210
many conference talks,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.820
even though they virtualized many last year.
So.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.899
But, yeah, I mean, before I just try to choose
my content, I take it from my real life experience.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:43.279
I mean, whatever I have done in my project,
right? Because,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:47.329
when working with multiple projects, of course
you realize that, okay, something can be improved

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:48.579
and, uh,

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:54.350
the knowledge which you get in your projects,
you will never get it, like even doing open

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.350
source.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.310
Right. You will not get that experience because
the problems we are trying to resolve or solve

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.160
in your project and the problem we are trying
to resolve in open source, they are totally

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.839
different. Right. So you get to learn a few
more things from your actually live projects.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:11.319
And that's, that's from where I generally
try to take the contents from.

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:15.480
Okay, I face this issue now and how can I
resolve it because again, probably a hundred

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.920
or thousands of developers are already facing
this issues.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:27.389
So for example, my, uh, I generally try to
repeat my performance optimization talk because

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:28.389
ofcourse that's,

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:31.810
that's important because I've seen multiple
projects suffering with those.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.670
And of course, a lot of developers can get
a benefit from them.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:40.259
Anuradha: Yeah, that's definitely right. I
mean, lots of people when get benefited and

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.160
yeah we should talk more about it.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.579
Um, so not only conferences, so like you had
so many streams and, uh, I guess articles

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:53.360
also as well, so different mediums of creating
content.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.269
Santosh: Yeah. So on livestreams, I generally
try to see like who is available and what

00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:01.129
they are good with.

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:05.730
So I try to give them the topic which they
feel comfortable with or what they are doing

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.730
currently.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.420
So let's say if I figure out, okay, someone
is actually have written a blog post on, let's

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.880
say anything, like, for example, NGRX, or React.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.480
Then I try to check with them if they
are comfortable coming to the talk show and

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.700
then talking about it.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.720
One thing is of course, as a host, you should
make them comfortable. Right.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.510
So I generally give them questions. These
are the questions in case you don't like,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.990
or you'd want to add or remove some questions
that's up

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.290
to you.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:38.089
So, that's really important thing because
whenever you realize, I mean, sometime I generally try

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:42.410
to give chance to the developers who
have never been on live stream and they really

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.790
get scared, but, most of them turn out to
be like, okay, it was really great Santosh,

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.860
because I felt really comfortable.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.029
And that's what I have learned from John Papa basically. When I went on to his first stream,

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:59.050
I was really scared. I'm talking to John Papa,
I was like, oh my God. And even Dan Wahlin

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.559
was there. So, but they made me really comfortable
while talking and then I just took the same

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.160
thing and then apply to my live streams.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.639
Anuradha: Yeah, this is so nice. I mean, definitely
because, making the guests comfortable is

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:18.300
definitely one important thing. Otherwise,
you won't get the best out of them.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:24.300
If they don't have good experience, then they
might feel that, yeah, this might not work.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:32.410
So, and I remember like, you inviting me on
your talk show also.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:38.310
And I was really happy because, I mean, I
didn't realize that, I was really maybe fit

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.629
to come on your talk show, but you invited,
so,

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:47.300
It boost my confidence. So yeah, that's really
nice of you.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:53.240
And to be honest, I mean, I really liked that,
calling people who are even new and giving

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.379
them a chance because they are doing good
and you want to give them a platform, that's

00:11:57.379 --> 00:11:58.379
really nice strategy.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:04.430
That's how you help others also rise up. So I'm actually definitely gonna implement this. I have

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:12.980
those plans for this interview series also.
Let's see how it goes, so, okay.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.420
Just a tangent question.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.070
Are you a morning person or night person?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.839
I mean, there is always lots of debate about
this on Twitter.

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:27.110
So I was curious, like, what do you find like personally working for you.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.360
Santosh: I mean it's, it's 11:30 pm. So what
do you think?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:40.399
I was never a morning person, so. I think it was because my school was in

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.009
afternoon.

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:48.319
So when I was a kid, so my school used to
be like at 12:30 pm, so I never used to actually wake

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:50.470
up before 9 or 10 am.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:56.709
And so that's how it started . The rough
phase was when I went to the college. So my

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:02.480
college was at 7 in the morning and I
had to travel like 30 to 45 minutes

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.661
from Mulund to Airoli (Mumbai), which was via bus. Then I suffered a lot because, of course, I

00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:15.720
used to miss lectures as well. I mean, of
course, when even though you reach early, you are

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.300
not sure about the bus, right. I mean

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.779
they have fixed timing. I used to miss buses a lot, but I mean, that was

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:27.680
like how many, three and three, six years
that was a rough phase. And I actually had to

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.867
attend college in morning.
Anuradha: That's totally opposite
for myself.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:39.819
 So I was curious, which school did you go to? Afternoon sounds like a very nice time to go to school.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:45.649
Santosh: It was in Mulund. It was called Dan vally
, it was in a Hindi medium school actually.

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:48.360
so, uh, yeah, and after.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:56.059
Anuradha: it sounds good - afternoon shift.
Santosh: I loved it.

00:13:56.059 --> 00:14:03.689
Anuradha: More and more schools need to be afternoon shift.
So I see all that you are doing

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:08.059
in tech. And I wanted to know, do you have other things that you

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:15.629
do apart from tech? Because like tech is not
only life, right? There is more to life.

00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:20.580
Santosh: So actually, when I was in Mumbai. So,
when I was actually working with a

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.120
startup, so we used to play football every
week, every wednesday. So that was

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.530
the last time and before that actually,
when I was in school and college, of course I

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.059
used to play cricket, but, then I took
my career really seriously, and then I stopped

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:34.059
doing everything.

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:39.800
And, after coming to Pune, actually I don't
have much friends here in Pune. I had one friend with

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.129
whom actually I used to go to weekends party.
I mean, with the family, of course, but then

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:50.209
he went to the US and then, again, he went
to us after the corona came, but I started

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:55.619
running last year. So, whenever I get time, actually, I just go for a run

00:14:55.619 --> 00:15:01.079
Like 5 kilometers daily. Not daily, but yeah, alternate days. So that's what I'm doing right

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:05.660
now, but yeah, I mean, uh, let's see. I mean, if I get like more people probably we

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.399
can start playing football again. I loved,
I loved playing football.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:18.819
Anuradha: That's nice. 5 KM is a big distance.
Santosh: I remember when I started, it's like,

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:23.279
I used to take one hour for five kilometers run,
but now I can complete in 30 minutes.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:29.720
So yeah, that's an achievement. 
Anuradha: I know because when I started walking

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.980
in the start, I was like, I would get breathless
very easily. And people who are walking

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.339
with me, they're like, what happened? I was
like, no, I just can't walk anymore.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:44.660
It takes time, but I think that's how we reclaim
our health. It is good.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.139
It is definitely a great hobby. Do you also like read books or something?

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:55.430
Read books or, watch movies. 
Santosh: So, uh, reading books. That's,

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:00.339
 it looks like, uh, my weakest area because in college, even when I, uh,

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:06.040
I used to actually read books in library and
I used to only read when I was in college.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:12.529
And I used to only read at home whenever I'm not falling asleep, sleepy.

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:18.050
So as soon as I realized, okay, I'm not going to sleep right, now let's,

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.980
let's read a book and within 5, 10 minutes,
of course I'm going to bed. So that

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.079
was my strategy in school. And. Now, it is
like, I, even though I need to read books

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.170
sometimes I cannot.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:35.790
So I finished few books. For example, I finished the book on Elon Musk,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.230
which was there. I purchased it and I finished
it, I really liked the story. So,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.910
I took like a week and finished it, but
I have still books, which I have purchased

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:53.999
like six months ago and I am still on chapter 2.

00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:00.360
Anuradha: For me reading, when I was small,
it was like opposite. Sleep was

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.339
kind of escaping reading because, my mom
would be like, yeah, you have to read.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.640
And she's looking at whether you are studying
or not. And then I would study and do like &lt;acting of dozing off&gt; .

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.000
And then, she would know that ok I'm acting, but still she would say - okay, If you are

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.289
trying to sleep, go to bed and sleep. So yeah.
Relief from studying.
Santosh: I know. [Laughs]

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:27.360
Even in movies, I mean, we really love watching movies.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.590
I mean, of course my daughter as well. So
generally, I mean, I love all the Marvel

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:39.940
movies and entire Avengers series, so let's see. I'm just waiting for this. 
Anuradha: Spiderman?

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:46.150
Santosh: Spiderman. But they (family) don't. I mean, generally I used to go alone sometime, but now

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:51.179
they say, okay, we will also go because
last two years we have, we haven't really

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:52.809
gone out of state, right.

00:17:52.809 --> 00:18:02.010
So they join me as well. So last week
we saw Eternals and then we saw Suryawanshi. And now let's

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.450
see. I mean, whenever I'm.
Anuradha: I also. I am a Marvel fan

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:13.549
So, it's so nice to hear that. I just love it, but I
haven't been able to watch the last few movies,

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:21.120
like, Eternals and Shang-Chi, but I think I should
go and watch it before, Spider-Man is almost

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:28.950
released. So yeah, I have lots to catch up now.
So coming back to

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.200
social media, like. I know you see it.
And I see it.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.880
Everyone is seeing this trend of hustle culture.
You know, lots of people keep talking about

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.230
keep hustling, keep hustling. So, uh, like what
do you personally think about this hustle culture.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:52.190
Santosh: I mean, I've done
that, I will not lie. Because when I

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.510
when I was in start-up, I've done that. I've done along with my team.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.290
So we used to come daily and then we used
to like, uh, whatever happens, we are

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.600
going to fix this issue. We have worked like
four days in a week. I mean for entire four days

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.419
we were in office or let's say, went to the
office at 2:00 AM in the early morning (mid-night?)

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:13.269
But I think at some point of time you realize
that it was not worth it.

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:18.659
I mean, of course at the end, what matters?
It's your family. And in case you are

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:23.470
doing it as an employee, I mean, why you're
doing it? You're getting paid 8 hours.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:31.409
You're not getting paid for like 24 hours a day.
So try to create a balance between those,

00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:33.490
of course, if it's your new, your own startup.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.539
I mean, people do that because of course at
the end, that's from where they are going

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:42.059
to earn money, but why you should do it as
an employee, what you are getting out of it.

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:46.590
You are getting nothing. I mean, believe me, once
you leave your job or once you decide to leave

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.090
your job, no one cares. You will be
replaced easily, but what can not be replaced

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.600
is the time you missed with your family.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.169
And I have missed a lot. I mean, I remember my daughter was born, and of

00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:03.101
course I was doing it because I had loans to pay, a lots of loans to pay because

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:11.300
of whatever happened during my daughter &lt;inaudible&gt;. But. After,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.710
like, I just realized that, okay, she's four
now.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.519
And what I have done, I have done nothing. I mean, I just lost all those time because I was just

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:27.039
too involved, like making money and making
sure that okay. I met my job. My work is actually

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:32.390
getting recognized at work, but at the end
of the day, after four years, I mean, it was

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.570
like, okay, I just wasted my time. I learned a
lot of course, because that was my first job

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.510
where I got the opportunity to actually work
on some real-time applications or get involved,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.700
in building something from scratch, but, I mean, it was not well-defined because,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:52.320
after leaving, what was there, nothing. I mean, if it was my own startup, of course

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.830
I would have done that, but still, I mean,
even in that case, keep a balance between

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:04.570
your family and, what is happening. I
mean, I saw a Twitter post, some months

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.760
ago where a guy who probably might be running his own start-up.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.700
So he posted that my daughter is born and then I'm working from hospital like

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.760
that, blah, blah, blah. I was like, okay,
what, why you are doing that? And why

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.650
you're showing it to people. I mean, what you're trying to prove. Enjoy this time,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.700
right? I mean, you're not going to get that time back again.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.330
You're not going to play with your daughter
when she was 2 again, I mean, you cannot

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.649
just go back, like you don't have super powers
to go back in time. Right? So that time lost

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:39.750
is lost. You can not do anything.
Anuradha: Yes, I totally agree. I agree that we all have

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:45.160
been there at some point in time, even I was
like working 12, 13 hours in the start, but

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.740
I do realize that

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:53.000
no, nothing is worth it because your
family and your health really matters a lot,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.799
and that is going to stay with you. So, yeah,
I really wanted to ask you this question just

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:02.320
to bring this out because, when I talk
to newcomers, they're always like,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.090
always into like, working odd hours and
I don't feel good about it because I have

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.090
done it too.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.799
And I know that I did not realize it back
then, but I had to pay for it. My health was

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:19.590
adversely affected because of that. So you
don't realize, but later you will realize,

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.721
I mean, few days are good I guess, like sometimes your company really needs

00:22:24.721 --> 00:22:29.929
you to work on weekends? Maybe there
is something very important, so that's okay.

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:33.690
that we can do, it's our responsibility, but
it shouldn't be daily.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:39.269
Santosh: Actually, if you're doing a daily, something is wrong with your organization.

00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:44.889
I mean, there are some companies
who also try to exploit you, right?

00:22:44.889 --> 00:22:49.409
I mean, you are a new fresher, you should
do that too. Believe me. I mean, I left my

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:55.980
first job because my CEO or whatever he was,
he actually asked me to just one day he asked

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.980
me to work till 8:30 pm.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.460
And next day, I resigned because from Day 1,
I had this policy that I'm not going to

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.450
work on someone else's terms. I mean, if you ask me to work for 12 hours,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:12.309
I will never do it. If I feel like I have
to work for 12 hours, I will do it. That was

00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:15.049
my policy. And then of course that fired back,
right?

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:22.019
I mean, in four years or five years where
I worked at startup. Because I was doing it,

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:26.780
my company took me for granted. So, remember this, even though you'd feel

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.779
like that I should work for 12 hours, never do it.
Because your company is going to take you

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:35.470
for granted that, okay, this guy will be available
at anytime and then they will make it practice.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:41.930
They will make it habit. So never do that
because if you start doing it next, next employees,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:48.167
whoever like next hundred or thousands of
employees suffer as well, because you just made a mistake.

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:54.010
 
Anuradha: Yeah. It happens. Because people
say that they don't have any problem in doing that

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:59.140
Santosh: Actually, why are you doing that, actually.
Anuradha: We are also setting a wrong example for others.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:06.080
If we don't do the right thing. Definitely.
So this is definitely a point worth

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:13.480
noting. Thank you. So, there are
lots of new things which keep coming up like

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.570
the new technologies, new frameworks and new
features within the same framework which you

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.710
are working with like, I mean, I read your
Twitter post on FOMO, like, I guess

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.289
a few weeks or months ago, maybe that you do not give in to the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:34.700
I want to know, like, how do you do it? It
hits so hard.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.860
Santosh: I know. Probably the reason is I have survived for too long. So I remember when I started with dotnet,

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.620
people were like use Java, learn Java. Java is
everything. And then I was like, no, I love

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.380
dotnet. So probably I'll stick with it. Then I

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.090
continued with dotnet and then I started
exploring new things. Of course you have a

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.700
lot of things to explore. Even if you get stuck
with a single framework. Believe me. I mean,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.920
even you work for two, three years, I still
get to learn a lot of new things in Angular.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.429
And I mean, I have been writing Angular for last 4 years now, close to 5 years.

00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:13.230
So, but I still get to learn something new daily. So why should I go back to something

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.080
new, which I even don't know about and then
have to. Remember, going back to another technology

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.890
is fine, but you have to always remeber that you
have to build your career from scratch, right?

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:28.200
You have to start from day zero and at end of
the day, you have to bring money at home, right.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.890
So I feel comfortable. Okay. I have
done, even though when I started with angular,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.490
I was actually restarting my career. I left a startup where I

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:42.900
worked for almost five years and then I was
restarting. I was like, okay, now what

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:48.350
next to do. I don't want to get stuck with dotnet
because dotnet was not open source at that

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.350
time.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.780
And I wanted to actually move into something,
some frontend and then Angular came in. I gave

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:00.420
it a chance and then it paid off. But,
just because who is coming with TypeScript.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.269
I mean, of course I love all the technologies
I love to learn. So, because that's what I

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:07.680
keep doing because I go to the talks and see, okay.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:14.500
How it, how it's done, explore things. I know, probably I can also do that. You have

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.600
to just follow the documentation. I mean, That's it, something that's Everyone can do. Right.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.330
But yeah, I mean, I have to choose my career
at the end of the day. I have to make money

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:28.340
out of it. So that's where I'm more focused
on, I mean, take any technology, if you're

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.620
really good at it, no one can ignore you.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.529
That's what I believe in. So I chose angular.
I know I'm good at it. That's why people pay

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:41.630
me, of course. Right. And it can be same with
you, choose React, choose Vue. Just be good at

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.020
it. And then you'll get to go into the market
and say, look, I need this much money and

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.890
no one will say no to you. Just prove yourself.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:54.460
Anuradha: Yes. I mean, yeah, that's what. I also don't get this, choosing one framework

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.429
over other thing. I mean, everything is
good. At the end of the day, it should like

00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:04.880
pay your bills and you should feel good working
with it. So that's all, I mean, that

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.850
should be it because yeah, money is needed. I
mean, I don't know.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:13.580
I mean, people need to say it louder and louder,
that it's okay that you are going behind a

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:21.350
shiny framework or anything, but it
should bring you money. Right. It should.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.919
Santosh: Otherwise, why you are doing it.

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:32.650
Anuradha: Do you have any suggestions for
the newcomers? Because I always see these

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:39.409
newcomers getting literally hit by these kinds
of things. There's lots of, I don't know what

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:46.289
we call it, but lots of so many posts on Twitter,
specifically which has like potential

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:49.919
to always play with mind of newcomers &lt;distract them&gt;.

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:54.950
Like at one moment they might think that this is good, at other moment

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:00.240
they might think that no, no, no. I should do this also, this also, this also. It's a lot for them.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.539
Santosh: I think that's one thing where the community builders are

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:09.879
doing something, probably not talking enough. So I can see a lot of 

00:28:09.879 --> 00:28:15.200
I mean, a lot of people on Twitter spreading,
like fear that you should learn this. I mean,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.620
of course, just few weeks ago. I mean, there
was a tweet that if you don't know this,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.830
this, this, you are not a web developer. So
those are the things I think we should not,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.500
give more exposure to. We are at fault.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:32.289
Believe me, I've seen account with like
50K followers, 100K followers doing the same

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:37.450
stuff. I mean, they're just posting react
versus angular versus Vue, what's your thought?

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.059
And then people are like shit posting. I mean,
they don't know because they have never worked

00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:43.799
with multiple frameworks. Right. And then.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:49.009
As that account has like 50 K or 100 K followers,
of course, students actually see, okay, this,

00:28:49.009 --> 00:28:55.240
this guy might be right. And other thing
is whenever there is something negative,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.879
which is posted, we give a lot of value to
it somehow. I'm not sure why. I mean, I want

00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:05.200
Anuradha: I always see negative posts getting more traction than the positive ones.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.110
Santosh: Yeah. I mean, if you see that, okay, this
is wrong. I mean, just leave it right. I mean,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:15.040
don't give like a focus to it. I mean, if
you're sharing it, you're sharing it in your

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.870
connection. I mean probably whatever, 10 K
20 K connections you have, you are actually sharing

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.960
it with them. And probably someone might get trapped.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.919
Right. I mean, okay, this is something we
have to learn. So for new students, I will

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:32.399
always suggest, just explore, right?
I mean, what you're afraid of.

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:35.809
You're just starting your career. Just go ahead and explore. What are the technologies

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:39.299
out there? What are different frameworks out there, just see which one you are comfortable with.

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:44.750
That's how actually, when I restarted
my career, I actually came to Angular. Uh,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:50.379
of course react was there as well. So I gave both a look and then I realized, okay,

00:29:50.379 --> 00:29:54.980
React had no support for TypeScript then.
It still doesn't have native

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.669
support, but yeah you can now go ahead and
thanks to typescript, like getting more involved

00:29:58.669 --> 00:30:00.159
in TSX.

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:04.740
They have added support now, but yeah,
I mean, back in that day, there was no support.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.809
So I chose, I mean, I thought, I saw React.
And I was like, okay, I have done angular JS,

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:12.799
but I think this is something which I
don't think I'll be more comfortable

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:17.580
with. And then I saw Angular. And I just saw, okay TypeScript,

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.070
which is closer to dotnet.
Done.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.067
So I'm going with this.

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:25.779
Anuradha: Yeah. I mean, everyone has a different journey and different experience,

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:29.200
so definitely explore for yourself because everybody we talk to

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.990
will have a different one. Like we were already talking

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.370
that there are lots

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.529
of negative things on Twitter as well.

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:40.951
And actually people also put each other down.
I mean, you will see trolls. Whenever we're

00:30:40.951 --> 00:30:46.630
creating even content or somewhere, people
might say something hurtful to you. It's hard

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:53.730
not to get de-motivated like, I mean,
obviously it would have happened for you also,

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:58.220
because I realized that a few days ago when
you were tweeting something and you deleted

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.179
it and then you again tweeted it because someone
tried to call you out on that.

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:10.070
Uh, but there was nothing wrong with it. It's
still, so, I mean, how do you handle it?

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:16.470
Santosh: Yeah, I mean, so something happened with me like around a year and a half ago. So someone

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.730
actually called me out, I mean, he was, of
course he was wrong. And, I was really

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.950
disappointed. I was really hurt because, I mean, it never happened with me.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.559
I was like, okay, I'm not spreading like false information. I'm just doing my work.

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:37.450
And then someone actually just went on to call me like a greedy person or something

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:43.460
like that. So I was really disappointed. I mean, I almost decided to quit the community.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:48.440
So I, I said, okay, now I'm done. I mean, I'm not going to stay with this Angular community

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.649
anymore, but I think at the end of the day,
You see, like, what type of connection

00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:54.649
you have made?

00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:59.120
So people stood up for me, they've actually,
some people were like fighting entire night

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.870
with that guy, just for me, because he said something to me. I was not even getting, I

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.820
mean, I was not even talking to him. I don't want to reply, reply him directly. So I ignored

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.140
him, but people started fighting for me and then I realized, okay, why I am doing it for,

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.539
I mean, if I even quit the community, what I'm going to get out of it.

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:22.009
I mean, of course a single guy versus like 10 different people who are actually

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:27.249
there fighting for me. So who matters? Not that one guy, of course, that he doesn't

00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:32.090
matter to me, but what other 10 people are doing for me that matters at the end of the

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:37.640
day. So, I mean, if you have like created yourself, like you have really good image

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.450
in the community, I don't think so that

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:45.620
anyone's opinion matters. Of course, we are free to actually give some kind of, let's

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.690
say a response. That's absolutely fine in case, let's say I did

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.169
some work. You find it incorrect. I mean, of course we can just go ahead and talk about it.

00:32:53.169 --> 00:33:00.230
But like targeting someone because he thinks that, okay, my opinion and your opinion

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.809
doesn't match, it's totally wrong.

00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:06.539
And it happens a lot on Twitter because of course it's a free platform, right. Anyone

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:13.200
can come and use it. And then there is, that's where everything goes wrong. And

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.499
some people think that okay, only they are right. And they try to actually force on to you.

00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:23.980
They don't try to actually, they don't try
to actually engage in like a distant conversation

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:30.690
or constructive feedback you can say, but
they try to just force onto you because they

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.799
know if I am wrong,

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:38.730
if I take this, as let's say, I am wrong here, probably I may lose followers. Believe me

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:44.149
that people do this. Once they realize that, okay, this thread or this particular Twitter

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:50.289
conversation is going against me, they will
delete the entire thread. People do that as well.

00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:53.950
So I would suggest, just stay away from such people.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:59.929
They, probably they are not the one you should be following or they are not

00:33:59.929 --> 00:34:07.120
the one you should get engaged, you talk a lot about talk on Twitter,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.510
just try to see. There are a lot of people who are trying to help genuinely. I mean,

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.300
everyone knows Danny, Danny Thompson is like doing a great job, try to follow those

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.300
guys. who are

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.780
actually putting some content and,  who are trying to actually help the community

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:27.530
really grow rather than following trolls or
listen to some trolls who are just doing some

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.730
stuff. And another thing is cancel culture.
And of course, I mean, there are some people

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:39.200
who do something intentionally, but calling them
out and then telling them to actually.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.359
Yeah. I mean,  you know, cancel culture, right? I mean, they start,

00:34:44.359 --> 00:34:49.690
stop following you. I mean, you should not have, even in that case, even though they

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:55.059
were wrong, but you should not be like that, that you are calling,

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.660
calling them out and saying, people should
not follow them.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.170
I mean, it's okay. Right. I mean, people can be wrong, but asking people not to follow

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:07.849
them it's something which you should not
do. People should realize it. Okay. Okay.

00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:12.290
This person was really wrong and probably
he's trying to share some wrong knowledge

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:18.070
or trying to be smart. I mean, it should be up to the users who are using twitter.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.480
It should not be your job to call them out and then say, okay, let's stop following this

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:28.859
guy. Let's unfollow his youtube, let's unfollow his blogs. I mean, that should not be what

00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:33.770
people be doing on Twitter. That's also very,
really bad. I mean, of course there are both

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.319
type of people. Right? I mean, there are good people who are trying to call them out, but

00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:39.839
I mean, that's not your job.

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:46.150
He was wrong. He was wrong. That's it? 
Anuradha: Yeah, it depends upon the

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:52.340
scenario. Definitely. And you are like, so right. We should not engage with people who are

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:57.160
spreading negativity or they're trolling because there are not many people like that. There

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.859
are lots of people who are spreading positivity, so we should rather follow them and interact

00:36:02.859 --> 00:36:06.311
with them because yeah, I mean, there are
lots of good people in the world.

00:36:06.311 --> 00:36:13.980
Life is too short to be paying attention
to these trolls and stuff. Definitely. Okay.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:21.859
So, uh, like we are almost at end of 2021 and new year is coming

00:36:21.859 --> 00:36:28.339
soon. So, I know that we have been in a very bad shape from

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:33.770
last two years due to pandemic and like everyone
is suffering and everyone is having a hard

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:34.770
time.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.990
Uh, but, still if you have to look back at 2021, What would you, how would you

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.730
look back at it? Like, what would you like
to take from it?

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:52.750
Santosh: Personally, 2021 was a great year for us. I mean, for our family. So I started consulting

00:36:52.750 --> 00:37:01.750
last year. So, uh, I was able to fix a
lot of things financially. And then,

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:08.570
I was able to help a lot of people. I ended
up like, supporting more people on GitHub sponsor

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:15.079
program. So over and over, I think it was really a really great year for us and looking

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:16.339
forward to 2022 now.

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:22.920
And I did miss one thing probably. So I was not able to do a lot of open source this year,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.980
but yeah, I mean, I was doing it in another way. I tried to actually do it via the videos,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.150
making content. Because of course everything takes time, even though, I mean, some people

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:38.020
are okay, they're writing code, but they won't be able to do other stuff.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.140
So my focus shifted from doing a lot of open source to creating contents this year.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:50.369
So probably next year, I'm probably, I'm trying to be back and do some, open source again,

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:56.400
but apart from, and what else. And, uh, of
course, I have an announcement, which I can

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.380
not do right now, but something coming up in 2022.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:07.290
Anuradha: Ooh, I'm really waiting for it. It's sounds exciting. And I think I mean, I could be wrong,

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:13.020
but I think that creating content also is a form of open source because if it's like

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.240
freely available to all, because people get benefit out of it and like, you have really

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.680
supported a lot, lots of open source people. So

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.809
It's also a kind of chain reaction, like the
open source, which they are doing is helping

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:32.270
community and you are helping them sustain it.
Santosh: Of course when I

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.480
when it started, I was like, okay, I'm not doing anything.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.740
I'm not contributing to open source. Then I realized, okay, in some ways I'm doing it,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:44.700
of course, if I'm not able to do it, I'm actually supporting someone who is able to do it right.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:49.440
Anuradha: It's, it's really nice. I mean, you are,
uh, your life is really a motivation and your

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:55.119
things. I always say that because, genuinely, I mean, you are one of the most

00:38:55.119 --> 00:39:00.490
humble persons and nice persons, who
I have ever met, and I'm really thankful that

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:06.510
I've met you in person.
Santosh: Same here.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:13.280
Anuradha: So, Last question. Do you do like yearly goal setting? So some big, high level things?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:20.770
Like, what do I want to do in 2022? Uh, like, do you want to share shome of that, If you would like to.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:27.030
Santosh: I mean, so believe me, I, as I had some goals for 2019 and 2020, then I stopped doing it

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.990
because I realized, I mean, I'm probably, I'm not going to do most of them.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:35.720
Uh, because in 2019, I was pretty sure that I, what I want to do is I want to contribute

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:42.079
to open source. That's what I did. Then in 2020, I
decided to actually, uh, the goal was to give

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:48.460
a lot of talks, which I did again. Then this covid happened. And then

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.660
I said, no, I'm not going to have any goal in 2021.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:56.980
Let it be how the life goes. I mean, I realize that, okay, life is too short to

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.530
predict something. I mean, to set it, set
goals, just leave it as it is, like, whatever

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:07.400
is going on. And before that, I never did
that. Just two years I had some goals,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:13.040
but before that I was like, my life was unpredictable and I was not sure what is going to happen next.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040
 

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.150
So it was like roller coaster. I mean, of course, you might've seen the blog,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.540
which I had written about my life, so I never believed in setting goals, but yeah. I mean,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.970
two years I did that and of course I had whatever goal I had, I achieved few of them, but now not

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:34.329
now. I mean, it's okay. I think whatever I'm doing, I will continue doing that.

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:41.240
Anuradha: Yeah, that's all good. Give it, like, give the control to life, like bring the best to me.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:48.930
Santosh: Actually
Anuradha: So, for the viewers, I will also put the link of Santosh's blog

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:55.050
that he is talking about, and I will also put his YouTube channel. It really

00:40:55.050 --> 00:41:00.630
has lots of good content - tech talks with Santosh, do check it out and follow

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.900
if you are not following him already.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:10.290
Uh, Thanks a lot Santosh for coming on my channel.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:15.549
It was really nice talking to you. 
Santosh: Same here.

00:41:15.549 --> 00:41:20.760
Anuradha: I thought that it would go maybe half an hour, but we definitely have surpassed by minutes.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:30.180
Santosh: You can edit it.
Anuradha: No, that's ok. Why should I edit it, there is no hard time

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.651
limit which I was looking for. I was thinking that I might not have enough to talk about, but

00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:39.240
yeah, we definitely had a lot to talk about, so
thank you. Thank you so much. Do you have

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.520
anything to say in the end? I mean, if you
want to say something.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.619
Santosh: The only thing I would like to say is, in case you are involved with

00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:53.530
the community, just go ahead and help others. That's, uh, I mean, make an example out of

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:59.000
you. It's not like you should be doing something, everything alone, don't do that. Try to

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.940
help other people as well. Once you have achieved something, try to pass that to other developers

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.330
as well.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.599
And in case you're not involved with the community, just go ahead and be part of it. 

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:14.230
Anuradha: Yes. Thank you. I mean, so that's such a nice suggestion.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.170
Thanks a lot again, it was very nice talking to you and having you on

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.000
my channel. Thank you.
Santosh: Same here.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Anuradha: bye.
